command.managed.execute conjunction user.start
user.data.synchronize
	# "user.data.synchronize" may implicitly or softly depend on "user.start" (i.e. when it starts a service).
	# The other way around may be also the case,
	# but it is assumed that programs stared by "user.start" can wait for "user.data.synchronize" to happen.

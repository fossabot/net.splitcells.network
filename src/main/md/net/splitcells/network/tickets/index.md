# Ticket Guidelines

## Storage Guidelines For This Repo

Only tickets that create lasting requirements should be stored in this repo
and be preserved.
The ticketing system in this repo is not thought to be used
as a forum or a planning tool.

It documents tickets that are done and signals tickets which
are being processed or planned.
It is preferred, that planned tickets and tickets in progress should only
contain their title,
if they are stored at all.
Please store the ticket content only in this repo,
if this ticket is done.

If a done ticket is update, this should only be done, if the update is complete,
in order to minimize the number of changes.

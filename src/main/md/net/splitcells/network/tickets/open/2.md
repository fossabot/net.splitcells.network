# Determine licensing.

## Licensing Goal

Dual licensing the program source code under the MIT and EPL 2.0 with the secondary licenses notice is considered the solution.
Thereby, one can relicense the project, if the license is considered to be incorrect.
On the other hand, one can still switch to EPL 2.0 only,
if the license is considered to be correct.

The rest of the source code is licensed like program source code.

This does not apply to external dependencies.

## Understanding

To my understanding of the EPL 2.0 license and the
[Eclipse EPL 2.0 FAQ](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-2.0/faq.php#epl-derivative)
Derivative Works do not seem to include works that merely link (or bind by name)
the original work and derivative works.

## Reasoning

Before that, dual licensing the program source code under MIT and Apache 2.0
was considered the correct way,
because Rust seemed to be a good open source role model.
The reasoning for [dual licensing](https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/rust-dev/2012-November/002664.html)
seemed to be good, so it was considered (permissive licensing and patent clause).

The Apache Software Foundation is an American organization,
whereas the Eclipse Foundation AISBL is an Euorpean-based organization.
The founder of the project is located in Europe,
so it makes more sense to target European communities.
The weak copy-left approach also enables some extended copyright protections,
while offering similar license compatibility,
so dual licensing with MIT and EPL 2.0 was adopted.

## Implementation

The [Eclipse Foundation Project Handbook](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/)
is used as a guide in order to determine licensing related
file layout and license notices.

Detailed information about EPL 2.0 can be found
[here](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-2.0/).

### Licensing On Project Basis

Every project in this repo is licensed under the same license.
Not every project needs a dedicated license info.
For now, it is enough if the license notice file is located at the top root
folder.

The `LICENSE.md` provides links to all licensing information
and also needs to explicitly state the licensing of the project files
without accounting for third party content (i.e. dependencies).

### Notice File

This file states the licenses of the project and its third party content.
The notice file should contain all licensing information,
except for the actual copies of the licenses etc.

```
# Notices for [project]

## Copyright

All content is the property of the respective authors or their employers.
For more information regarding authorship of content, please consult the
listed source code repository logs.

## Project Licenses

[...]

## Third Party Content

[Third Party Content ID/Name and Version]

* License: [...]
* Website: [...]
* Source Code: [...]

```

### File License Header

```

```
> This is the license header for Java files.

### License Information on File Basis

Each file should have its own licensing info.
In other words licensing is done on a per-file basis.
It is recommended, that the licensing info is located in the licensed files itself.
This is usually done via copyright headers.

Alternatively, Licensing info of a file can be split into a separate file,
but each such file needs its own separate licensing file.
This is separate licensing file should be in the same folder as the file with
the actual content.
Their relation should be clearly visible by using the same file prefix.

### License Obligations

Every copy and distribution of this project should contain copies of the licenses,
the notice and the license file.
Each distribution format should provide easy access to these things.
It is recommended to not change the licensing of the project's. 

#Organize Contributions

## Determine contribution protocol.

The Linux kernel and Git are the main role models for this. 

## Determine contribution documents.

The `CONTRIBUTING.md` and the `Developer_Certificate_of_Origin.v1.1.txt`
are used as contribution guidelines.
Support information and tutorials will also be added
as they are needed.

# Determine licensing.

## Licensing Goal

Dual licensing the program source code under the MIT and EPL 2.0 with the secondary licenses notice is considered the solution.
Thereby, one can relicense the project, if the license is considered to be incorrect.
On the other hand, one can still switch to EPL 2.0 only,
if the license is considered to be correct.

The documentation is licensed under 

## Reasoning

Before that, dual licensing the program source code under MIT and Apache 2.0
was considered the correct way,
because Rust seemed to be a good open source role model.
The reasoning for [dual licensing](https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/rust-dev/2012-November/002664.html)
seemed to be good, so it was adopted (permissive licensing and patent clause).

The Apache Software Foundation is an American organization,
whereas the Eclipse Foundation AISBL is an Euorpean-based organization.
The founder of the project is located in Europe,
so it makes more sense to target European communities.
The weak copy-left approach also enables some extended copyright protections,
while offering similar license compatibility.

## Implementation

Each file should have its own licensing info.
In other words licensing is done on a per-file basis.

Licensing info of a file can be split into a separate file,
but each such file needs its own separate licensing file.
This is separate licensing file should be in the same folder as the file with
the actual content.
Their relation should be clearly visible by using the same file prefix.

Detailed information about EPL 2.0 can be found
[here](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-2.0/).

The [Eclipse Foundation Project Handbook](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/)
is used as a guide in order to determine licensing related
file layout and license notices.

#Organize Contributions

## Determine contribution protocol.

The Linux kernel and Git are the main role models for this. 

## Determine contribution documents.

The `CONTRIBUTING.md` and the `Developer_Certificate_of_Origin.v1.1.txt`
are used as contribution guidelines.
Support information and tutorials will also be added
as they are needed.

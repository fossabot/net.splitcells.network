# Determine licensing.

## Licensing Goal

Dual licensing the program source code under the MIT and EPL 2.0 with the secondary licenses notice is considered the solution.
Thereby, one can relicense the project, if the license is considered to be incorrect.
On the other hand, one can still switch to EPL 2.0 only,
if the license is considered to be correct.

## Reasoning

Before that, dual licensing the program source code under MIT and Apache 2.0
was considered the correct way,
because Rust seemed to be a good open source role model.
The reasoning for [dual licensing](https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/rust-dev/2012-November/002664.html)
seemed to be good, so it was adopted.

The Apache Software Foundation is an American organization,
whereas the Eclipse Foundation AISBL is an Euorpean-based organization.
The founder of the project is located in Europe,
so it makes more sense to target European communities.
The weak copy-left approach also enables some extended copyright protections,
while offering similar license compatibility.

## Implementation

Detailed information about EPL 2.0 can be found
[here](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-2.0/).

The [Eclipse Foundation Project Handbook](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/)
is used as a guide in order to determine licensing related
file layout and license notices.

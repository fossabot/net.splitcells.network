        <title>Globalization</title>
        <paragraph>Globalization is the act of minimizing the number
            of networks or making it easy to translate, connect and traverse such network clusters.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>It is often not possible, to make a single global unified network,
            that is valid for everyone.
            This is often not needed. Instead one can use shared global networks,
            where each network has its own root perspective and therefore path space.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>Every non global network can just link to these globally shared networks.
            The root perspectives of each network needs to isolated in such a way,
            that these are not mixed.
            This ensures that paths are unambiguous and can be shared across networks.
            Thereby, networks can be integrated.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>Generally speaking, the number of networks, should be minimized
            in order to have minimal cost of optimizing and using the networks.
            Nevertheless, one has to keep in mind, that each actor/project needs its own root perspective
            and therefore network. It may be enough to use virtual networks.

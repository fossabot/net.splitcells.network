    <objective>Ensure that a software project's dependencies like language, framework and platforms
        are easily replaceable. The replacement can be automatic or manual.
        <solution>Ensure that the software project is valid and only uses certain features,
            that makes it easy to migrate the project.
            <toDo>Standardize usage of Java feature by defining a subset of valid Java grammar and checking it.
                <toDo>Use different Grammar for Dem and subsequent projects,
                    because Dem is the base for subsequent projects, which should have higher restriction.</toDo>
            </toDo>
            <idea>Always translate code to other language automatically and test it, in order to be sure
                that the code is portable.</idea>

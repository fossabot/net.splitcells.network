# Terminal based Dependency Injection
(I kind of think, that I'm using the false term for this.)
On different systems different programs need to be executed in order to achieve the same thing.
In most cases the user does not have any interest about this detail, but he still has to use these programs.
This framework provides simple terminal commands that execute the required code depending on the current system.

The programs called by this framework can be developed independently or used on its own as long as some rules are meet.
Also the programs are mostly not provided by this framework, but are copied into an existing installation of this framework.

In other words the detailed technical know-how of managing operation systems is not provided by this framework.

# Introduction to the Generic Allocator

## Introduction for Users

TODO

The Generic Allocator (Gel) is a Java framework for optimization problems.
The framework's primary objective is to provide helpful information regarding a given problem and/or a
solving routine.

It provides tools to model problems simply and understandably,
because without this ability such endeavours become unnecessarily hard and time consuming.
It does this by providing an API, that asks for the required input data step by step in order to build the model.
Simultaneously it gives the information on how to produce such data.

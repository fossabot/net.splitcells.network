## Description

This is a set of open source projects centered around optimization and code supporting and integrating such projects.
The center of all this is the [Generic Allocator](./projects/net.splitcells.gel).
It is a Java framework providing modeling, analytic and solving capabilities regarding optimization problems.
An introduction and documentation can be found [here](http://splitcells.net/net/splitcells/gel/index.html).

## Structure

This is the root project of a project cluster.
This network consists of three parts:
* [net.splitcells.system](./projects/net.splitcells.system):
  A set of integrated projects focused on optimization and problem modeling.
* [net.splitcells.network](http://splitcells.net):
  This project integrates all repositories and hosting services,
  that are part of the network.
  It also helps to manage the repository for users.
* Unintegrated projects:
  These projects are not inside this repository and managed more independently.

## Primary Work

<img src="http://splitcells.net/net/splitcells/martins/avots/website/images/license.standard/net.splitcells.network.logo.jpg" width="50%" alt="Logo"/>

We provide a set of open source projects centered around optimization and code supporting and integrating such projects.
The core is the [Generic Allocator](./projects/net.splitcells.gel).
It is a Java framework providing modeling, analytic and solving capabilities regarding optimization problems.
An introduction and documentation can be found [here](http://splitcells.net/net/splitcells/gel/index.html).

## Secondary Product

Another interesting subproject is [OS State Interface](./projects/net.splitcells.os.state.interface).
It helps the user to organize and execute commands in the terminal. 

## Project structure Structure

This is the root project of a project cluster. This network consists of three parts:

* [net.splitcells.system](./projects/net.splitcells.system/README.md):
  A set of integrated projects focused on optimization and problem modeling.
* [net.splitcells.network](http://splitcells.net):
  This project integrates all repositories and hosting services, that are part of the network.
* Unintegrated projects:
  These projects are not inside this repository and managed are more independently.
  They may be managed by users with [OS state interface](./projects/net.splitcells.os.state.interface/README.md).
